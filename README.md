# u_project
overview :
This project is one of the projects in my Data Science Nano-degree at Udacity. and In this project, i will try to create a ML model, which will be able to predict when users at Sparkify are about to churn.
libraries :
i used many but the important ones are 
1- numpy 
2- matlab 
problems i got :
the large amount of data is one of the biggest problems .
Results :
At the end of this project, two main iterations on a churn-prediction model were implemented and evaluated. The first model used a simple pivot of the event that seemed to contain the most relevant difference between churning and non-churning users.

Three models were trained with this data , and the accuracies are :

Gradient Boosted Trees - 68.9%

Random Forest - 68.4%

SVM - 68.4%

data files :
1- readme
2- sparkify
